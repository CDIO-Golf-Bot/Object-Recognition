Implement path planning and route visualization on the grid:
  ‚Ä¢ A* search, Manhattan heuristic, and path compression.
  ‚Ä¢ Select top N balls and brute-force TSP-style best route to a goal.
  ‚Ä¢ Compute and cache full route in cm & grid cells.
  ‚Ä¢ Draw the complete path with real-world scaling on camera frames.
  ‚Ä¢ Save a planned route to disk.
